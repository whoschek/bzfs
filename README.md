<!-- BEGIN DESCRIPTION SECTION -->
*bzfs is a backup command line tool that reliably replicates ZFS
snapshots from a (local or remote) source ZFS dataset (ZFS filesystem or
ZFS volume) and its descendant datasets to a (local or remote)
destination ZFS dataset to make the destination dataset a recursively
synchronized copy of the source dataset, using zfs
send/receive/rollback/destroy and ssh tunnel as directed. For example,
bzfs can be used to incrementally replicate all ZFS snapshots since the
most recent common snapshot from source to destination, in order to help
protect against data loss or ransomware.*

When run for the first time, bzfs replicates the dataset and all its
snapshots from the source to the destination. On subsequent runs, bzfs
transfers only the data that has changed since the previous run, i.e. it
incrementally replicates to the destination all intermediate snapshots
that have been created on the source since the last run. Source ZFS
snapshots older than the most recent common snapshot found on the
destination are auto-skipped.

bzfs does not create or delete ZFS snapshots on the source - it assumes
you have a ZFS snapshot management tool to do so, for example
policy-driven Sanoid, zrepl, pyznap, zfs-auto-snapshot, zfs_autobackup,
manual zfs snapshot/destroy, etc. bzfs treats the source as read-only,
thus the source remains unmodified. With the --dryrun flag, bzfs also
treats the destination as read-only. In normal operation, bzfs treats
the destination as append-only. Optional CLI flags are available to
delete destination snapshots and destination datasets as directed, for
example to make the destination identical to the source if the two have
somehow diverged in unforeseen ways. This easily enables
(re)synchronizing the backup from the production state, as well as
restoring the production state from backup.

In the spirit of rsync, bzfs supports a variety of powerful
include/exclude filters that can be combined to select which datasets,
snapshots and properties to replicate or delete or compare.

The source 'pushes to' the destination whereas the destination 'pulls
from' the source. bzfs is installed and executed on the 'initiator'
host which can be either the host that contains the source dataset (push
mode), or the destination dataset (pull mode), or both datasets (local
mode, no network required, no ssh required), or any third-party (even
non-ZFS OSX) host as long as that host is able to SSH (via standard
'ssh' CLI) into both the source and destination host (pull-push mode).
In pull-push mode the source 'zfs send's the data stream to the
initiator which immediately pipes the stream (without storing anything
locally) to the destination host that 'zfs receive's it. Pull-push
mode means that bzfs need not be installed or executed on either source
or destination host. Only the underlying 'zfs' CLI must be installed
on both source and destination host. bzfs can run as root or non-root
user, in the latter case via a) sudo or b) when granted corresponding
ZFS permissions by administrators via 'zfs allow' delegation
mechanism.

bzfs is written in Python and continously runs a wide set of unit tests
and integration tests to ensure coverage and compatibility with old and
new versions of ZFS on Linux, FreeBSD and Solaris, on all Python
versions >= 3.7 (including latest stable which is currently
python-3.13).

bzfs is a stand-alone program with zero required dependencies,
consisting of a single file, akin to a stand-alone shell script or
binary executable. It is designed to be able to run in restricted
barebones server environments. No external Python packages are required;
indeed no Python package management at all is required. You can just
copy the file wherever you like, for example into /usr/local/bin or
similar, and simply run it like any stand-alone shell script or binary
executable.

Optionally, bzfs applies bandwidth rate-limiting and progress monitoring
(via 'pv' CLI) during 'zfs send/receive' data transfers. When run
across the network, bzfs also transparently inserts lightweight data
compression (via 'zstd -1' CLI) and efficient data buffering (via
'mbuffer' CLI) into the pipeline between network endpoints during
'zfs send/receive' network transfers. If one of these utilities is not
installed this is auto-detected, and the operation continues reliably
without the corresponding auxiliary feature.

# Example Usage

* Example in local mode (no network, no ssh) to replicate ZFS dataset
tank1/foo/bar to tank2/boo/bar:


```
$ bzfs tank1/foo/bar tank2/boo/bar
```



```
$ zfs list -t snapshot tank1/foo/bar
tank1/foo/bar@test_2024-11-06_08:30:05_daily
tank1/foo/bar@test_2024-11-07_08:30:06_daily

$ zfs list -t snapshot tank2/boo/bar
tank2/boo/bar@test_2024-11-06_08:30:05_daily
tank2/boo/bar@test_2024-11-07_08:30:06_daily 
```


* Same example in pull mode:

` bzfs root@host1.example.com:tank1/foo/bar tank2/boo/bar`

* Same example in push mode:

` bzfs tank1/foo/bar root@host2.example.com:tank2/boo/bar`

* Same example in pull-push mode:

` bzfs root@host1:tank1/foo/bar root@host2:tank2/boo/bar`

* Example in local mode (no network, no ssh) to recursively replicate
ZFS dataset tank1/foo/bar and its descendant datasets to tank2/boo/bar:


```
$ bzfs tank1/foo/bar tank2/boo/bar --recursive
```



```
$ zfs list -t snapshot -r tank1/foo/bar
tank1/foo/bar@test_2024-11-06_08:30:05_daily
tank1/foo/bar@test_2024-11-07_08:30:06_daily
tank1/foo/bar/baz@test_2024-11-06_08:40:00_daily
tank1/foo/bar/baz@test_2024-11-07_08:40:00_daily

$ zfs list -t snapshot -r tank2/boo/bar
tank2/boo/bar@test_2024-11-06_08:30:05_daily
tank2/boo/bar@test_2024-11-07_08:30:06_daily
tank2/boo/bar/baz@test_2024-11-06_08:40:00_daily
tank2/boo/bar/baz@test_2024-11-07_08:40:00_daily 
```


* Example that makes destination identical to source even if the two
have drastically diverged:

` bzfs tank1/foo/bar tank2/boo/bar --recursive --force
--delete-dst-datasets --delete-dst-snapshots`

* Replicate all daily snapshots created during the last 7 days, and at
the same time ensure that the latest 7 daily snapshots (per dataset) are
replicated regardless of creation time:

` bzfs tank1/foo/bar tank2/boo/bar --recursive
--include-snapshot-regex '.*_daily'
--include-snapshot-times-and-ranks '7 days ago..*' 'latest 7'`

* Delete all daily snapshots older than 7 days, but ensure that the
latest 7 daily snapshots (per dataset) are retained regardless of
creation time:

` bzfs dummy tank2/boo/bar --dryrun --recursive --skip-replication
--delete-dst-snapshots --include-snapshot-regex '.*_daily'
--include-snapshot-times-and-ranks 'latest 7..latest 100%'
--include-snapshot-times-and-ranks '*..7 days ago'`

* Delete all daily snapshots older than 7 days, but ensure that the
latest 7 daily snapshots (per dataset) are retained regardless of
creation time. Additionally, only delete a snapshot if no corresponding
snapshot or bookmark exists in the source dataset (same as above except
replace the 'dummy' source with 'tank1/foo/bar'):

` bzfs tank1/foo/bar tank2/boo/bar --dryrun --recursive
--skip-replication --delete-dst-snapshots --include-snapshot-regex
'.*_daily' --include-snapshot-times-and-ranks 'latest 7..latest
100%' --include-snapshot-times-and-ranks '*..7 days ago'`

* Delete all daily snapshots older than 7 days, but ensure that the
latest 7 daily snapshots (per dataset) are retained regardless of
creation time. Additionally, only delete a snapshot if no corresponding
snapshot exists in the source dataset (same as above except append
'no-crosscheck'):

` bzfs tank1/foo/bar tank2/boo/bar --dryrun --recursive
--skip-replication --delete-dst-snapshots --include-snapshot-regex
'.*_daily' --include-snapshot-times-and-ranks 'latest 7..latest
100%' --include-snapshot-times-and-ranks '*..7 days ago'
--delete-dst-snapshots-no-crosscheck`

* Delete all daily bookmarks older than 90 days, but retain the latest
200 daily bookmarks (per dataset) regardless of creation time:

` bzfs dummy tank1/foo/bar --dryrun --recursive --skip-replication
--delete-dst-snapshots=bookmarks --include-snapshot-regex
'.*_daily' --include-snapshot-times-and-ranks 'latest 200..latest
100%' --include-snapshot-times-and-ranks '*..90 days ago'`

* Delete all tmp datasets within tank2/boo/bar:

` bzfs dummy tank2/boo/bar --dryrun --recursive --skip-replication
--delete-dst-datasets --include-dataset-regex 'tmp.*'`

* Compare source and destination dataset trees recursively, for example
to check if all recently taken snapshots have been successfully
replicated by a periodic job. List snapshots only contained in src
(tagged with 'src'), only contained in dst (tagged with 'dst'), and
contained in both src and dst (tagged with 'all'), restricted to
hourly and daily snapshots taken within the last 7 days, excluding the
last 4 hours (to allow for some slack/stragglers), excluding temporary
datasets:

` bzfs tank1/foo/bar tank2/boo/bar --skip-replication
--compare-snapshot-lists=src+dst+all --recursive
--include-snapshot-regex '.*_(hourly|daily)'
--include-snapshot-times-and-ranks '7 days ago..4 hours ago'
--exclude-dataset-regex 'tmp.*'`

If the resulting TSV output file contains zero lines starting with the
prefix 'src' and zero lines starting with the prefix 'dst' then no
source snapshots are missing on the destination, and no destination
snapshots are missing on the source, indicating that the periodic
replication and pruning jobs perform as expected. The TSV output is
sorted by dataset, and by ZFS creation time within each dataset - the
first and last line prefixed with 'all' contains the metadata of the
oldest and latest common snapshot, respectively. The
--compare-snapshot-lists option also directly logs various summary
stats, such as the metadata of the latest common snapshot, latest
snapshots and oldest snapshots, as well as the time diff between the
latest common snapshot and latest snapshot only in src (and only in
dst), as well as how many src snapshots and how many GB of data are
missing on dst, etc.

* Example with further options:

` bzfs tank1/foo/bar root@host2.example.com:tank2/boo/bar --recursive
--exclude-snapshot-regex '.*_(hourly|frequent)'
--exclude-snapshot-regex 'test_.*'
--include-snapshot-times-and-ranks '7 days ago..*' 'latest 7'
--exclude-dataset /tank1/foo/bar/temporary --exclude-dataset
/tank1/foo/bar/baz/trash --exclude-dataset-regex '(.*/)?private'
--exclude-dataset-regex
'(.*/)?[Tt][Ee]?[Mm][Pp][-_]?[0-9]*'
--ssh-dst-private-key /root/.ssh/id_rsa`

# Design Aspects

* Rsync'ish look and feel.
* Supports a variety of powerful include/exclude filters that can be combined to select which datasets, snapshots and
properties to replicate or delete or compare.
* Supports pull, push, pull-push and local transfer mode.
* Prioritizes safe, reliable and predictable operations. Clearly separates read-only mode, append-only mode and
delete mode.
* Continously tested on Linux, FreeBSD and Solaris.
* Code is almost 100% covered by tests.
* Simple and straightforward: Can be installed in less than a minute. Can be fully scripted without configuration
files, or scheduled via cron or similar. Does not require a daemon other than ubiquitous sshd.
* Stays true to the ZFS send/receive spirit. Retains the ability to use ZFS CLI options for fine tuning. Does not
attempt to "abstract away" ZFS concepts and semantics. Keeps simple things simple, and makes complex things possible.
* All ZFS and SSH commands (even in --dryrun mode) are logged such that they can be inspected, copy-and-pasted into
a terminal/shell, and run manually to help anticipate or diagnose issues.
* Supports replicating (or deleting) dataset subsets via powerful include/exclude regexes and other filters, which can
be combined into a mini filter pipeline. For example, can replicate (or delete) all except temporary datasets and
private datasets. Can be told to do such deletions only if a corresponding source dataset does not exist.
* Supports replicating (or deleting) snapshot subsets via powerful include/exclude regexes, time based filters, and
oldest N/latest N filters, which can also be combined into a mini filter pipeline.
    * For example, can replicate (or delete) daily and weekly snapshots while ignoring hourly and 5 minute snapshots.
Or, can replicate daily and weekly snapshots to a remote destination while replicating hourly and 5 minute snapshots
to a local destination.
    * For example, can replicate (or delete) all daily snapshots older (or newer) than 90 days, and all weekly snapshots
older (or newer) than 12 weeks.
    * For example, can replicate (or delete) all daily snapshots except the latest (or oldest) 90 daily snapshots,
and all weekly snapshots except the latest (or oldest) 12 weekly snapshots.
    * For example, can replicate all daily snapshots that were created during the last 7 days, and at the
same time ensure that at least the latest 7 daily snapshots are replicated regardless of creation time.
This helps to safely cope with irregular scenarios where no snapshots were created or received within the last 7 days,
or where more than 7 daily snapshots were created or received within the last 7 days.
    * For example, can delete all daily snapshots older than 7 days, but retain the latest 7 daily
snapshots regardless of creation time. It can help to avoid accidental pruning of the last snapshot that source and
destination have in common.
    * Can be told to do such deletions only if a corresponding snapshot does not exist in the source dataset.
* Compare source and destination dataset trees recursively, in combination with snapshot filters and dataset filters.
* Also supports replicating arbitrary dataset tree subsets by feeding it a list of flat datasets.
* Efficiently supports complex replication policies with multiple sources and multiple destinations for each source.
* Can be told what ZFS dataset properties to copy, also via include/exclude regexes.
* Full and precise ZFS bookmark support for additional safety, or to reclaim disk space earlier.
* Can be strict or told to be tolerant of runtime errors.
* Automatically resumes ZFS send/receive operations that have been interrupted by network hiccups or other
intermittent failures, via efficient 'zfs receive -s' and 'zfs send -t'.
* Similarly, can be told to automatically retry snapshot delete operations.
* Parametrizable retry logic.
* Multiple bzfs processes can run in parallel. If multiple processes attempt to write to the same destination dataset
simultaneously this is detected and the operation can be auto-retried safely.
* A job that runs periodically declines to start if the same previous periodic job is still running without
completion yet.
* Can log to local and remote destinations out of the box. Logging mechanism is customizable and plugable for smooth
integration.
* Codebase is easy to change, hack and maintain. No hidden magic. Python is very readable to contemporary engineers.
Chances are that CI tests will catch changes that have unintended side effects.
* It's fast!


# Automated Test Runs

Results of automated test runs on a matrix of various old and new versions of ZFS/Python/Linux/FreeBSD/Solaris are
[here](https://github.com/whoschek/bzfs/actions/workflows/python-app.yml?query=event%3Aschedule), as generated
by [this script](https://github.com/whoschek/bzfs/blob/main/.github/workflows/python-app.yml).
The script also demonstrates functioning installation steps on Ubuntu, FreeBSD, Solaris, etc.
The script also generates code coverage reports which are published
[here](https://whoschek.github.io/bzfs/coverage).

The gist is that it should work on any flavor, with python (3.7 or higher, no additional python packages required)
only needed on the initiator host.


# How To Run Unit Tests on GitHub

* First, on the GitHub page of this repo, click on "Fork/Create a new fork".
* Click the 'Actions' menu on your repo, and then enable GitHub Actions on your fork.
* Then select 'All workflows' -> 'Tests' on the left side.
* Then click the 'Run workflow' dropdown menu on the right side.
* Select the name of the job to run (e.g. 'test_ubuntu_24_04' or 'test_freebsd_14_1' or 'test_solaris_11_4', etc) or
select 'Run all jobs' to test all supported platforms, plus select the git branch to run with (typically the branch
containing your changes).
* Then click the 'Run workflow' button which kicks off the job.
* Click on the job to watch job progress.
* Once the run completes, you can click on the wheel on the top right to select 'Download log archive', which is
a zip file containing the output of all jobs of the run. This is useful for debugging.
* Once the job completes, also a coverage report appears on the bottom of the run page, which you can download by
clicking on it. Unzip and browse the HTML coverage report to see if the code you added or changed is actually executed
by a test. Experience shows that code that isn't executed likely contains bugs, so all changes (code lines and
branch conditions) should be covered by a test before a merge is considered. In practice, this means to watch out
for coverage report lines that aren't colored green.
* FYI, example test runs with coverage reports are
[here](https://github.com/whoschek/bzfs/actions/workflows/python-app.yml?query=event%3Aschedule).
Click on any run and browse to the bottom of the resulting run page to find the coverage reports, including a combined
coverage report that merges all jobs of the run.


# How To Run Unit Tests Locally
```
# verify zfs is installed
zfs --version

# verify python 3.7 or higher is installed
python3 --version

# verify sudo is working
sudo ls

# set this for unit tests if sshd is on a non-standard port (default is 22)
# export bzfs_test_ssh_port=12345
# export bzfs_test_ssh_port=22

# verify user can ssh in passwordless via loopback interface and private key
ssh -p $bzfs_test_ssh_port 127.0.0.1 echo hello

# verify zfs is on PATH
ssh -p $bzfs_test_ssh_port 127.0.0.1 zfs --version

# verify zpool is on PATH
ssh -p $bzfs_test_ssh_port 127.0.0.1 zpool --version

# verify zstd is on PATH for compression to become enabled
ssh -p $bzfs_test_ssh_port 127.0.0.1 zstd --version

# verify pv is on PATH for progress monitoring to become enabled
ssh -p $bzfs_test_ssh_port 127.0.0.1 pv --version

# verify mbuffer is on PATH for efficient buffering to become enabled
ssh -p $bzfs_test_ssh_port 127.0.0.1 mbuffer --version

# Finally, run unit tests. If cloned from git:
./test.sh

# Finally, run unit tests. If installed via 'pip install':
bzfs-test
```

**SRC_DATASET DST_DATASET**

*  SRC_DATASET: Source ZFS dataset (and its descendants) that will be
    replicated. Can be a ZFS filesystem or ZFS volume. Format is
    [[user@]host:]dataset. The host name can also be an IPv4 address
    (or an IPv6 address where each ':' colon character must be
    replaced with a '|' pipe character for disambiguation). If the
    host name is '-', the dataset will be on the local host, and the
    corresponding SSH leg will be omitted. The same is true if the host
    is omitted and the dataset does not contain a ':' colon at the
    same time. Local dataset examples: `tank1/foo/bar`, `tank1`,
    `-:tank1/foo/bar:baz:boo` Remote dataset examples:
    `host:tank1/foo/bar`, `host.example.com:tank1/foo/bar`,
    `root@host:tank`, `root@host.example.com:tank1/foo/bar`,
    `user@127.0.0.1:tank1/foo/bar:baz:boo`,
    `user@||1:tank1/foo/bar:baz:boo`. The first component of the ZFS
    dataset name is the ZFS pool name, here `tank1`. If the option
    starts with a `+` prefix then dataset names are read from the
    UTF-8 text file given after the `+` prefix, with each line in the
    file containing a SRC_DATASET and a DST_DATASET, separated by a tab
    character. Example: `+root_dataset_names.txt`,
    `+/path/to/root_dataset_names.txt`

    DST_DATASET: Destination ZFS dataset for replication and deletion.
    Has same naming format as SRC_DATASET. During replication,
    destination datasets that do not yet exist are created as necessary,
    along with their parent and ancestors.



<div id="--recursive"></div>

**--recursive**, **-r**

*  During replication and deletion, also consider descendant datasets,
    i.e. datasets within the dataset tree, including children, and
    children of children, etc.

<!-- -->

<div id="--include-dataset"></div>

**--include-dataset** *DATASET [DATASET ...]*

*  During replication and deletion, select any ZFS dataset (and its
    descendants) that is contained within SRC_DATASET (DST_DATASET in
    case of deletion) if its dataset name is one of the given include
    dataset names but none of the exclude dataset names. If a dataset is
    excluded its descendants are automatically excluded too, and this
    decision is never reconsidered even for the descendants because
    exclude takes precedence over include.

    A dataset name is absolute if the specified dataset is prefixed by
    `/`, e.g. `/tank/baz/tmp`. Otherwise the dataset name is
    relative wrt. source and destination, e.g. `baz/tmp` if the source
    is `tank`.

    This option is automatically translated to an
    --include-dataset-regex (see below) and can be specified multiple
    times.

    If the option starts with a `+` prefix then dataset names are read
    from the newline-separated UTF-8 text file given after the `+`
    prefix, one dataset per line inside of the text file. Examples:
    `/tank/baz/tmp` (absolute), `baz/tmp` (relative),
    `+dataset_names.txt`, `+/path/to/dataset_names.txt`

<!-- -->

<div id="--exclude-dataset"></div>

**--exclude-dataset** *DATASET [DATASET ...]*

*  Same syntax as --include-dataset (see above) except that the option
    is automatically translated to an --exclude-dataset-regex (see
    below).

<!-- -->

<div id="--include-dataset-regex"></div>

**--include-dataset-regex** *REGEX [REGEX ...]*

*  During replication (and deletion), select any ZFS dataset (and its
    descendants) that is contained within SRC_DATASET (DST_DATASET in
    case of deletion) if its relative dataset path (e.g. `baz/tmp`)
    wrt. SRC_DATASET (DST_DATASET in case of deletion) matches at least
    one of the given include regular expressions but none of the exclude
    regular expressions. If a dataset is excluded its descendants are
    automatically excluded too, and this decision is never reconsidered
    even for the descendants because exclude takes precedence over
    include.

    This option can be specified multiple times. A leading `!`
    character indicates logical negation, i.e. the regex matches if the
    regex with the leading `!` character removed does not match.

    Default: `.*` (include all datasets). Examples: `baz/tmp`,
    `(.*/)?doc[^/]*/(private|confidential).*`, `!public`

<!-- -->

<div id="--exclude-dataset-regex"></div>

**--exclude-dataset-regex** *REGEX [REGEX ...]*

*  Same syntax as --include-dataset-regex (see above) except that the
    default is `(.*/)?[Tt][Ee]?[Mm][Pp][-_]?[0-9]*`
    (exclude tmp datasets). Example: `!.*` (exclude no dataset)

<!-- -->

<div id="--exclude-dataset-property"></div>

**--exclude-dataset-property** *STRING*

*  The name of a ZFS dataset user property (optional). If this option
    is specified, the effective value (potentially inherited) of that
    user property is read via 'zfs list' for each selected source
    dataset to determine whether the dataset will be included or
    excluded, as follows:

    a) Value is 'true' or '-' or empty string or the property is
    missing: Include the dataset.

    b) Value is 'false': Exclude the dataset and its descendants.

    c) Value is a comma-separated list of fully qualified host names
    (no spaces, for example:
    'store001.example.com,store002.example.com'): Include the dataset
    if the fully qualified host name of the host executing bzfs is
    contained in the list, otherwise exclude the dataset and its
    descendants.

    If a dataset is excluded its descendants are automatically excluded
    too, and the property values of the descendants are ignored because
    exclude takes precedence over include.

    Examples: 'syncoid:sync', 'com.example.eng.project.x:backup'

    *Note:* The use of --exclude-dataset-property is discouraged for
    most use cases. It is more flexible, more powerful, *and* more
    efficient to instead use a combination of
    --include/exclude-dataset-regex and/or --include/exclude-dataset
    to achieve the same or better outcome.

<!-- -->

<div id="--include-snapshot-regex"></div>

**--include-snapshot-regex** *REGEX [REGEX ...]*

*  During replication and deletion, select any source ZFS snapshot that
    has a name (i.e. the part after the '@') that matches at least one
    of the given include regular expressions but none of the exclude
    regular expressions. If a snapshot is excluded this decision is
    never reconsidered because exclude takes precedence over include.

    This option can be specified multiple times. A leading `!`
    character indicates logical negation, i.e. the regex matches if the
    regex with the leading `!` character removed does not match.

    Default: `.*` (include all snapshots). Examples: `test_.*`,
    `!prod_.*`, `.*_(hourly|frequent)`,
    `!.*_(weekly|daily)`

    *Note:* All --include/exclude-snapshot-* CLI option groups are
    combined into a mini filter pipeline. A filter pipeline is executed
    in the order given on the command line, left to right. For example
    if --include-snapshot-ranks (see below) is specified on the command
    line before --include/exclude-snapshot-regex, then
    --include-snapshot-ranks will be applied before
    --include/exclude-snapshot-regex. The pipeline results would not
    always be the same if the order were reversed. Order matters.

    *Note:* During replication, bookmarks are always retained aka
    selected in order to help find common snapshots between source and
    destination.

<!-- -->

<div id="--exclude-snapshot-regex"></div>

**--exclude-snapshot-regex** *REGEX [REGEX ...]*

*  Same syntax as --include-snapshot-regex (see above) except that the
    default is to exclude no snapshots.

<!-- -->

<div id="--include-snapshot-times-and-ranks"></div>

**--include-snapshot-times-and-ranks** *TIMERANGE [RANKRANGE ...]*

*  This option takes as input parameters a time range filter and an
    optional rank range filter. It separately computes the results for
    each filter and selects the UNION of both results. To instead use a
    pure rank range filter (no UNION), or a pure time range filter (no
    UNION), simply use '0..0' to indicate an empty time range, or omit
    the rank range, respectively. This option can be specified multiple
    times.

    <b>*Replication Example (UNION):* </b>

    Specify to replicate all daily snapshots created during the last 7
    days, and at the same time ensure that the latest 7 daily snapshots
    (per dataset) are replicated regardless of creation time, like so:
    `--include-snapshot-regex '.*_daily'
    --include-snapshot-times-and-ranks '7 days ago..*' 'latest
    7'`

    <b>*Deletion Example (no UNION):* </b>

    Specify to delete all daily snapshots older than 7 days, but ensure
    that the latest 7 daily snapshots (per dataset) are retained
    regardless of creation time, like so: `--include-snapshot-regex
    '.*_daily' --include-snapshot-times-and-ranks 'latest
    7..latest 100%' --include-snapshot-times-and-ranks '*..7 days
    ago'`

    This helps to safely cope with irregular scenarios where no
    snapshots were created or received within the last 7 days, or where
    more than 7 daily snapshots were created within the last 7 days. It
    can also help to avoid accidental pruning of the last snapshot that
    source and destination have in common.

    <b>*TIMERANGE:* </b>

    The ZFS 'creation' time of a snapshot (and bookmark) must fall
    into this time range in order for the snapshot to be included. The
    time range consists of a 'start' time, followed by a '..'
    separator, followed by an 'end' time. For example
    '2024-01-01..2024-04-01' or `*..*` aka all times. Only
    snapshots (and bookmarks) in the half-open time range [start, end)
    are included; other snapshots (and bookmarks) are excluded. If a
    snapshot is excluded this decision is never reconsidered because
    exclude takes precedence over include. Each of the two specified
    times can take any of the following forms:

    * a) a `*` wildcard character representing negative or positive
    infinity.

    * b) a non-negative integer representing a UTC Unix time in
    seconds. Example: 1728109805

    * c) an ISO 8601 datetime string with or without timezone.
    Examples: '2024-10-05', '2024-10-05T14:48:55',
    '2024-10-05T14:48:55+02', '2024-10-05T14:48:55-04:30'. If the
    datetime string does not contain time zone info then it is assumed
    to be in the local time zone. Timezone string support requires
    Python >= 3.11.

    * d) a duration that indicates how long ago from the current time,
    using the following syntax: a non-negative integer, followed by an
    optional space, followed by a duration unit that is *one* of
    'seconds', 'secs', 'minutes', 'mins', 'hours', 'days',
    'weeks', followed by an optional space, followed by the word
    'ago'. Examples: '0secs ago', '90 mins ago', '48hours ago',
    '90days ago', '12weeksago'.

    * Note: This option compares the specified time against the
    standard ZFS 'creation' time property of the snapshot (which is a
    UTC Unix time in integer seconds), rather than against a timestamp
    that may be part of the snapshot name. You can list the ZFS creation
    time of snapshots and bookmarks as follows: `zfs list -t
    snapshot,bookmark -o name,creation -s creation -d 1 $SRC_DATASET`
    (optionally add the -p flag to display UTC Unix time in integer
    seconds).

    *Note:* During replication, bookmarks are always retained aka
    selected in order to help find common snapshots between source and
    destination.

    <b>*RANKRANGE:* </b>

    Specifies to include the N (or N%) oldest snapshots or latest
    snapshots, and exclude all other snapshots (default: include no
    snapshots). Snapshots are sorted by creation time (actually, by the
    'createtxg' ZFS property, which serves the same purpose but is
    more precise). The rank position of a snapshot is the zero-based
    integer position of the snapshot within that sorted list. A rank
    consist of the word 'oldest' or 'latest', followed by a
    non-negative integer, followed by an optional '%' percent sign. A
    rank range consists of a lower rank, followed by a '..' separator,
    followed by a higher rank. If the optional lower rank is missing it
    is assumed to be 0. Examples:

    * 'oldest 10%' aka 'oldest 0..oldest 10%' (include the oldest
    10% of all snapshots)

    * 'latest 10%' aka 'latest 0..latest 10%' (include the latest
    10% of all snapshots)

    * 'oldest 90' aka 'oldest 0..oldest 90' (include the oldest 90
    snapshots)

    * 'latest 90' aka 'latest 0..latest 90' (include the latest 90
    snapshots)

    * 'oldest 90..oldest 100%' (include all snapshots except the
    oldest 90 snapshots)

    * 'latest 90..latest 100%' (include all snapshots except the
    latest 90 snapshots)

    * 'latest 1' aka 'latest 0..latest 1' (include the latest
    snapshot)

    * 'latest 1..latest 100%' (include all snapshots except the
    latest snapshot)

    * 'oldest 2' aka 'oldest 0..oldest 2' (include the oldest 2
    snapshots)

    * 'oldest 2..oldest 100%' (include all snapshots except the
    oldest 2 snapshots)

    * 'oldest 100%' aka 'oldest 0..oldest 100%' (include all
    snapshots)

    * 'oldest 0%' aka 'oldest 0..oldest 0%' (include no snapshots)

    * 'oldest 0' aka 'oldest 0..oldest 0' (include no snapshots)

    *Note:* Percentage calculations are not based on the number of
    snapshots contained in the dataset on disk, but rather based on the
    number of snapshots arriving at the filter. For example, if only two
    daily snapshots arrive at the filter because a prior filter excludes
    hourly snapshots, then 'latest 10' will only include these two
    daily snapshots, and 'latest 50%' will only include one of these
    two daily snapshots.

    *Note:* During replication, bookmarks are always retained aka
    selected in order to help find common snapshots between source and
    destination. Bookmarks do not count towards N or N% wrt. rank.

    *Note:* If a snapshot is excluded this decision is never
    reconsidered because exclude takes precedence over include.

<div id="--zfs-send-program-opts"></div>

**--zfs-send-program-opts** *STRING*

*  Parameters to fine-tune 'zfs send' behaviour (optional); will be
    passed into 'zfs send' CLI. The value is split on runs of one or
    more whitespace characters. Default is '--props --raw

**--zfs-recv-program-opts** *STRING*

*  Parameters to fine-tune 'zfs receive' behaviour (optional); will
    be passed into 'zfs receive' CLI. The value is split on runs of
    one or more whitespace characters. Default is '-u'. Example: '-u
    -o canmount=noauto -o readonly=on -x keylocation -x keyformat -x

**--zfs-recv-program-opt** *STRING*

*  Parameter to fine-tune 'zfs receive' behaviour (optional); will be
    passed into 'zfs receive' CLI. The value can contain spaces and is
    not split. This option can be specified multiple times. Example:
    `--zfs-recv-program-opt=-o
    --zfs-recv-program-opt='org.zfsbootmenu:commandline=ro debug
    zswap.enabled=1'`

<!-- -->

<div id="--force-rollback-to-latest-snapshot"></div>

**--force-rollback-to-latest-snapshot**

*  Before replication, rollback the destination dataset to its most
    recent destination snapshot (if there is one), via 'zfs rollback',
    just in case the destination dataset was modified since its most
    recent snapshot. This is much less invasive than the other
    --force* options (see below).

<!-- -->

<div id="--force-rollback-to-latest-common-snapshot"></div>

**--force-rollback-to-latest-common-snapshot**

*  Before replication, delete destination ZFS snapshots that are more
    recent than the most recent common snapshot selected on the source
    ('conflicting snapshots'), via 'zfs rollback'. Abort with an
    error if no common snapshot is selected but the destination already
    contains a snapshot.

<!-- -->

<div id="--force"></div>

**--force**

*  Same as --force-rollback-to-latest-common-snapshot (see above),
    except that additionally, if no common snapshot is selected, then
    delete all destination snapshots before starting replication, and
    proceed without aborting. Without the --force* flags, the
    destination dataset is treated as append-only, hence no destination
    snapshot that already exists is deleted, and instead the operation
    is aborted with an error when encountering a conflicting snapshot.

    Analogy: --force-rollback-to-latest-snapshot is a tiny hammer,
    whereas --force-rollback-to-latest-common-snapshot is a medium
    sized hammer, and --force is a large hammer. Consider using the
    smallest hammer that can fix the problem. No hammer is ever used by
    default.

<!-- -->

<div id="--force-unmount"></div>

**--force-unmount**

*  On destination, --force and
    --force-rollback-to-latest-common-snapshot will add the '-f' flag
    to their use of 'zfs rollback' and 'zfs destroy'.

<!-- -->

<div id="--force-once"></div>

**--force-once**, **--f1**

*  Use the --force option or
    --force-rollback-to-latest-common-snapshot option at most once to
    resolve a conflict, then abort with an error on any subsequent
    conflict. This helps to interactively resolve conflicts, one
    conflict at a time.

<!-- -->

<div id="--skip-parent"></div>

**--skip-parent**

*  During replication and deletion, skip processing of the SRC_DATASET
    and DST_DATASET and only process their descendant datasets, i.e.
    children, and children of children, etc (with --recursive). No
    dataset is processed unless --recursive is also specified. Analogy:
    `bzfs --recursive --skip-parent src dst` is akin to Unix `cp -r
    src/* dst/` whereas `bzfs --recursive --skip-parent
    --skip-replication --delete-dst-datasets dummy dst` is akin to
    Unix `rm -r dst/*`

<!-- -->

<div id="--skip-missing-snapshots"></div>

**--skip-missing-snapshots** *[{fail,dataset,continue}]*

*  During replication, handle source datasets that select no snapshots
    (and no relevant bookmarks) as follows:

    a) 'fail': Abort with an error.

    b) 'dataset' (default): Skip the source dataset with a warning.
    Skip descendant datasets if --recursive and destination dataset
    does not exist. Otherwise skip to the next dataset.

    c) 'continue': Skip nothing. If destination snapshots exist,
    delete them (with --force) or abort with an error (without
    --force). If there is no such abort, continue processing with the
    next dataset. Eventually create empty destination dataset and
    ancestors if they do not yet exist and source dataset has at least
    one descendant that selects at least one snapshot.

<!-- -->

<div id="--retries"></div>

**--retries** *INT*

*  The maximum number of times a retryable replication or deletion step
    shall be retried if it fails, for example because of network hiccups
    (default: 2, min: 0). Also consider this option if a periodic
    pruning script may simultaneously delete a dataset or snapshot or
    bookmark while bzfs is running and attempting to access it.

<!-- -->

<div id="--retry-min-sleep-secs"></div>

**--retry-min-sleep-secs** *FLOAT*

*  The minimum duration to sleep between retries (default: 0.125).

<!-- -->

<div id="--retry-max-sleep-secs"></div>

**--retry-max-sleep-secs** *FLOAT*

*  The maximum duration to sleep between retries initially starts with
    --retry-min-sleep-secs (see above), and doubles on each retry, up
    to the final maximum of --retry-max-sleep-secs (default: 300). On
    each retry a random sleep time in the [--retry-min-sleep-secs,
    current max] range is picked. The timer resets after each
    operation.

<!-- -->

<div id="--retry-max-elapsed-secs"></div>

**--retry-max-elapsed-secs** *FLOAT*

*  A single operation (e.g. 'zfs send/receive' of the current
    dataset, or deletion of a list of snapshots within the current
    dataset) will not be retried (or not retried anymore) once this much
    time has elapsed since the initial start of the operation, including
    retries (default: 3600). The timer resets after each operation
    completes or retries exhaust, such that subsequently failing
    operations can again be retried.

<!-- -->

<div id="--skip-on-error"></div>

**--skip-on-error** *{fail,tree,dataset}*

*  During replication and deletion, if an error is not retryable, or
    --retries has been exhausted, or --skip-missing-snapshots raises
    an error, proceed as follows:

    a) 'fail': Abort the program with an error. This mode is ideal
    for testing, clear error reporting, and situations where consistency
    trumps availability.

    b) 'tree': Log the error, skip the dataset tree rooted at the
    dataset for which the error occurred, and continue processing the
    next (sibling) dataset tree. Example: Assume datasets tank/user1/foo
    and tank/user2/bar and an error occurs while processing tank/user1.
    In this case processing skips tank/user1/foo and proceeds with
    tank/user2.

    c) 'dataset' (default): Same as 'tree' except if the
    destination dataset already exists, skip to the next dataset
    instead. Example: Assume datasets tank/user1/foo and tank/user2/bar
    and an error occurs while processing tank/user1. In this case
    processing skips tank/user1 and proceeds with tank/user1/foo if the
    destination already contains tank/user1. Otherwise processing
    continues with tank/user2. This mode is for production use cases
    that require timely forward progress even in the presence of partial
    failures. For example, assume the job is to backup the home
    directories or virtual machines of thousands of users across an
    organization. Even if replication of some of the datasets for some
    users fails due too conflicts, busy datasets, etc, the replication
    job will continue for the remaining datasets and the remaining
    users.

<!-- -->

<div id="--skip-replication"></div>

**--skip-replication**

*  Skip replication step (see above) and proceed to the optional
    --delete-dst-datasets step immediately (see below).

<!-- -->

<div id="--delete-dst-datasets"></div>

**--delete-dst-datasets**

*  Do nothing if the --delete-dst-datasets option is missing.
    Otherwise, after successful replication step, if any, delete
    existing destination datasets that are selected via
    --{include|exclude}-dataset* policy yet do not exist within
    SRC_DATASET (which can be an empty dataset, such as the hardcoded
    virtual dataset named 'dummy'!). Does not recurse without
    --recursive.

    For example, if the destination contains datasets h1,h2,h3,d1
    whereas source only contains h3, and the include/exclude policy
    selects h1,h2,h3,d1, then delete datasets h1,h2,d1 on the
    destination to make it 'the same'. On the other hand, if the
    include/exclude policy only selects h1,h2,h3 then only delete
    datasets h1,h2 on the destination to make it 'the same'.

    Example to delete all tmp datasets within tank2/boo/bar: `bzfs
    dummy tank2/boo/bar --dryrun --skip-replication
    --delete-dst-datasets --include-dataset-regex 'tmp.*'
    --recursive`

<!-- -->

<div id="--delete-dst-snapshots"></div>

**--delete-dst-snapshots** *[{snapshots,bookmarks}]*

*  Do nothing if the --delete-dst-snapshots option is missing.
    Otherwise, after successful replication, and successful
    --delete-dst-datasets step, if any, delete existing destination
    snapshots whose GUID does not exist within the source dataset (which
    can be an empty dummy dataset!) if the destination snapshots are
    selected by the --include/exclude-snapshot-* policy, and the
    destination dataset is selected via --{include|exclude}-dataset*
    policy. Does not recurse without --recursive.

    For example, if the destination dataset contains snapshots
    h1,h2,h3,d1 (h=hourly, d=daily) whereas the source dataset only
    contains snapshot h3, and the include/exclude policy selects
    h1,h2,h3,d1, then delete snapshots h1,h2,d1 on the destination
    dataset to make it 'the same'. On the other hand, if the
    include/exclude policy only selects snapshots h1,h2,h3 then only
    delete snapshots h1,h2 on the destination dataset to make it 'the
    same'.

    *Note:* To delete snapshots regardless, consider using
    --delete-dst-snapshots in combination with a source that is an
    empty dataset, such as the hardcoded virtual dataset named
    'dummy', like so: `bzfs dummy tank2/boo/bar --dryrun
    --skip-replication --delete-dst-snapshots
    --include-snapshot-regex '.*_daily' --recursive`

    *Note:* Use --delete-dst-snapshots=bookmarks to delete bookmarks
    instead of snapshots, in which case no snapshots are selected and
    the --{include|exclude}-snapshot-* filter options treat bookmarks
    as snapshots wrt. selecting.

<!-- -->

<div id="--delete-dst-snapshots-no-crosscheck"></div>

**--delete-dst-snapshots-no-crosscheck**

*  This flag indicates that --delete-dst-snapshots=snapshots shall
    check the source dataset only for a snapshot with the same GUID, and
    ignore whether a bookmark with the same GUID is present in the
    source dataset. Similarly, it also indicates that
    --delete-dst-snapshots=bookmarks shall check the source dataset
    only for a bookmark with the same GUID, and ignore whether a
    snapshot with the same GUID is present in the source dataset.

<!-- -->

<div id="--delete-empty-dst-datasets"></div>

**--delete-empty-dst-datasets** *[{snapshots,snapshots+bookmarks}]*

*  Do nothing if the --delete-empty-dst-datasets option is missing or
    --recursive is missing. Otherwise, after successful replication
    step and successful --delete-dst-datasets and successful
    --delete-dst-snapshots steps, if any, delete any selected
    destination dataset that has no snapshot and no bookmark if all
    descendants of that destination dataset are also selected and do not
    have a snapshot or bookmark either (again, only if the existing
    destination dataset is selected via --{include|exclude}-dataset*
    policy). Never delete excluded dataset subtrees or their ancestors.

    For example, if the destination contains datasets h1,d1, and the
    include/exclude policy selects h1,d1, then check if h1,d1 can be
    deleted. On the other hand, if the include/exclude policy only
    selects h1 then only check if h1 can be deleted.

    *Note:* Use --delete-empty-dst-datasets=snapshots to delete
    snapshot-less datasets even if they still contain bookmarks.

<!-- -->

<div id="--compare-snapshot-lists"></div>

**--compare-snapshot-lists** *[{src,dst,all,src+dst,src+all,dst+all,src+dst+all}]*

*  Do nothing if the --compare-snapshot-lists option is missing.
    Otherwise, after successful replication step and successful
    --delete-dst-datasets, --delete-dst-snapshots steps and
    --delete-empty-dst-datasets steps, if any, proceed as follows:

    Compare source and destination dataset trees recursively wrt.
    snapshots, for example to check if all recently taken snapshots have
    been successfully replicated by a periodic job.

    Example: List snapshots only contained in source (tagged with
    'src'), only contained in destination (tagged with 'dst'), and
    contained in both source and destination (tagged with 'all'),
    restricted to hourly and daily snapshots taken within the last 7
    days, excluding the last 4 hours (to allow for some
    slack/stragglers), excluding temporary datasets: `bzfs
    tank1/foo/bar tank2/boo/bar --skip-replication
    --compare-snapshot-lists=src+dst+all --recursive
    --include-snapshot-regex '.*_(hourly|daily)'
    --include-snapshot-times-and-ranks '7 days ago..4 hours ago'
    --exclude-dataset-regex 'tmp.*'`

    This outputs a TSV file containing the following columns:

    `location creation_iso createtxg rel_name guid root_dataset
    rel_dataset name creation written`

    Example output row:

    `src 2024-11-06_08:30:05 17435050
    /foo@test_2024-11-06_08:30:05_daily 2406491805272097867 tank1/src
    /foo tank1/src/foo@test_2024-10-06_08:30:04_daily 1730878205 24576`

    If the TSV output file contains zero lines starting with the prefix
    'src' and zero lines starting with the prefix 'dst' then no
    source snapshots are missing on the destination, and no destination
    snapshots are missing on the source, indicating that the periodic
    replication and pruning jobs perform as expected. The TSV output is
    sorted by rel_dataset, and by ZFS creation time within each
    rel_dataset - the first and last line prefixed with 'all' contains
    the metadata of the oldest and latest common snapshot, respectively.
    Third party tools can use this info for post-processing, for example
    using custom scripts using 'csplit' or duckdb analytics queries.

    The --compare-snapshot-lists option also directly logs various
    summary stats, such as the metadata of the latest common snapshot,
    latest snapshots and oldest snapshots, as well as the time diff
    between the latest common snapshot and latest snapshot only in src
    (and only in dst), as well as how many src snapshots and how many GB
    of data are missing on dst, etc.

    *Note*: Consider omitting the 'all' flag to reduce noise and
    instead focus on missing snapshots only, like so:
    --compare-snapshot-lists=src+dst

    *Note*: The source can also be an empty dataset, such as the
    hardcoded virtual dataset named 'dummy'.

    *Note*: --compare-snapshot-lists is typically *much* faster
    than standard 'zfs list -t snapshot' CLI usage because the former
    issues I/O requests with a higher degree of parallelism than the
    latter.

<div id="--dryrun"></div>

**--dryrun** *[{recv,send}]*, **-n** *[{recv,send}]*

*  Do a dry run (aka 'no-op') to print what operations would happen
    if the command were to be executed for real (optional). This option
    treats both the ZFS source and destination as read-only. Accepts an
    optional argument for fine tuning that is handled as follows:

    a) 'recv': Send snapshot data via 'zfs send' to the destination
    host and receive it there via 'zfs receive -n', which discards the
    received data there.

    b) 'send': Do not execute 'zfs send' and do not execute 'zfs
    receive'. This is a less 'realistic' form of dry run, but much
    faster, especially for large snapshots and slow networks/disks, as
    no snapshot is actually transferred between source and destination.
    This is the default when specifying --dryrun.

    Examples: --dryrun, --dryrun=send, --dryrun=recv

<!-- -->

<div id="--verbose"></div>

**--verbose**, **-v**

*  Print verbose information. This option can be specified multiple
    times to increase the level of verbosity. To print what ZFS/SSH
    operation exactly is happening (or would happen), add the `-v -v`
    flag, maybe along with --dryrun. All ZFS and SSH commands (even
    with --dryrun) are logged such that they can be inspected,
    copy-and-pasted into a terminal shell and run manually to help
    anticipate or diagnose issues. ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG, TRACE
    output lines are identified by [E], [W], [I], [D], [T]
    prefixes, respectively.

<!-- -->

<div id="--quiet"></div>

**--quiet**, **-q**

*  Suppress non-error, info, debug, and trace output.

<!-- -->

<div id="--no-privilege-elevation"></div>

**--no-privilege-elevation**, **-p**

*  Do not attempt to run state changing ZFS operations 'zfs
    create/rollback/destroy/send/receive' as root (via 'sudo -u root'
    elevation granted by administrators appending the following to
    /etc/sudoers: `<NON_ROOT_USER_NAME> ALL=NOPASSWD:/path/to/zfs`

    Instead, the --no-privilege-elevation flag is for non-root users
    that have been granted corresponding ZFS permissions by
    administrators via 'zfs allow' delegation mechanism, like so: sudo
    zfs allow -u $SRC_NON_ROOT_USER_NAME send,bookmark $SRC_DATASET;
    sudo zfs allow -u $DST_NON_ROOT_USER_NAME
    mount,create,receive,rollback,destroy,canmount,mountpoint,readonly,compression,encryption,keylocation,recordsize
    $DST_DATASET_OR_POOL.

    For extra security $SRC_NON_ROOT_USER_NAME should be different than
    $DST_NON_ROOT_USER_NAME, i.e. the sending Unix user on the source
    and the receiving Unix user at the destination should be separate
    Unix user accounts with separate private keys even if both accounts
    reside on the same machine, per the principle of least privilege.
    Further, if you do not plan to use the --force* flags and
    --delete-* CLI options then ZFS permissions 'rollback,destroy'
    can be omitted. If you do not plan to customize the respective ZFS
    dataset property then ZFS permissions
    'canmount,mountpoint,readonly,compression,encryption,keylocation,recordsize'
    can be omitted, arriving at the absolutely minimal set of required
    destination permissions: `mount,create,receive`.

<div id="--no-stream"></div>

**--no-stream**

*  During replication, only replicate the most recent selected source
    snapshot of a dataset (using -i incrementals instead of -I
    incrementals), hence skip all intermediate source snapshots that may
    exist between that and the most recent common snapshot. If there is
    no common snapshot also skip all other source snapshots for the
    dataset, except for the most recent selected source snapshot. This
    option helps the destination to 'catch up' with the source ASAP,
    consuming a minimum of disk space, at the expense of reducing
    reliable options for rolling back to intermediate snapshots in the
    future.

<!-- -->

<div id="--no-resume-recv"></div>

**--no-resume-recv**

*  Replication of snapshots via 'zfs send/receive' can be interrupted
    by intermittent network hiccups, hardware issues, etc. Interrupted
    'zfs send/receive' operations are retried if the --retries and
    --retry-* options enable it (see above). In normal operation bzfs
    automatically retries such that only the portion of the snapshot is
    transmitted that has not yet been fully received on the destination.
    For example, this helps to progressively transfer a large individual
    snapshot over a wireless network in a timely manner despite frequent
    intermittent network hiccups. This optimization is called 'resume
    receive' and uses the 'zfs receive -s' and 'zfs send -t'
    feature.

    The --no-resume-recv option disables this optimization such that a
    retry now retransmits the entire snapshot from scratch, which could
    slow down or even prohibit progress in case of frequent network
    hiccups. bzfs automatically falls back to using the
    --no-resume-recv option if it is auto-detected that the ZFS pool
    does not reliably support the 'resume receive' optimization.

    *Note:* Snapshots that have already been fully transferred as part
    of the current 'zfs send/receive' operation need not be
    retransmitted regardless of the --no-resume-recv flag. For example,
    assume a single 'zfs send/receive' operation is transferring
    incremental snapshots 1 through 10 via 'zfs send -I', but the
    operation fails while transferring snapshot 10, then snapshots 1
    through 9 need not be retransmitted regardless of the
    --no-resume-recv flag, as these snapshots have already been
    successfully received at the destination either way.

<!-- -->

<div id="--no-create-bookmark"></div>

**--no-create-bookmark**

*  For increased safety, in normal operation bzfs behaves as follows
    wrt. ZFS bookmark creation, if it is autodetected that the source
    ZFS pool support bookmarks: Whenever it has successfully completed
    replication of the most recent source snapshot, bzfs creates a ZFS
    bookmark of that snapshot and attaches it to the source dataset.
    Bookmarks exist so an incremental stream can continue to be sent
    from the source dataset without having to keep the already
    replicated snapshot around on the source dataset until the next
    upcoming snapshot has been successfully replicated. This way you can
    send the snapshot from the source dataset to another host, then
    bookmark the snapshot on the source dataset, then delete the
    snapshot from the source dataset to save disk space, and then still
    incrementally send the next upcoming snapshot from the source
    dataset to the other host by referring to the bookmark.

    The --no-create-bookmark option disables this safety feature but is
    discouraged, because bookmarks are tiny and relatively cheap and
    help to ensure that ZFS replication can continue even if source and
    destination dataset somehow have no common snapshot anymore. For
    example, if a pruning script has accidentally deleted too many (or
    even all) snapshots on the source dataset in an effort to reclaim
    disk space, replication can still proceed because it can use the
    info in the bookmark (the bookmark must still exist in the source
    dataset) instead of the info in the metadata of the (now missing)
    source snapshot.

    A ZFS bookmark is a tiny bit of metadata extracted from a ZFS
    snapshot by the 'zfs bookmark' CLI, and attached to a dataset,
    much like a ZFS snapshot. Note that a ZFS bookmark does not contain
    user data; instead a ZFS bookmark is essentially a tiny pointer in
    the form of the GUID of the snapshot and 64-bit transaction group
    number of the snapshot and creation time of the snapshot, which is
    sufficient to tell the destination ZFS pool how to find the
    destination snapshot corresponding to the source bookmark and
    (potentially already deleted) source snapshot. A bookmark can be fed
    into 'zfs send' as the source of an incremental send. Note that
    while a bookmark allows for its snapshot to be deleted on the source
    after successful replication, it still requires that its snapshot is
    not somehow deleted prematurely on the destination dataset, so be
    mindful of that. By convention, a bookmark created by bzfs has the
    same name as its corresponding snapshot, the only difference being
    the leading '#' separator instead of the leading '@' separator.

    You can list bookmarks, like so: `zfs list -t bookmark -o
    name,guid,createtxg,creation -d 1 $SRC_DATASET`, and you can (and
    should) periodically prune obsolete bookmarks just like snapshots,
    like so: `zfs destroy $SRC_DATASET#$BOOKMARK`. Typically,
    bookmarks should be pruned less aggressively than snapshots, and
    destination snapshots should be pruned less aggressively than source
    snapshots. As an example starting point, here is a command that
    deletes all bookmarks older than 90 days, but retains the latest 200
    bookmarks (per dataset) regardless of creation time: `bzfs dummy
    tank2/boo/bar --dryrun --recursive --skip-replication
    --delete-dst-snapshots=bookmarks
    --include-snapshot-times-and-ranks '0..0' 'latest 200..latest
    100%' --include-snapshot-times-and-ranks '*..90 days ago'`

<!-- -->

<div id="--no-use-bookmark"></div>

**--no-use-bookmark**

*  For increased safety, in normal replication operation bzfs also
    looks for bookmarks (in addition to snapshots) on the source dataset
    in order to find the most recent common snapshot wrt. the
    destination dataset, if it is auto-detected that the source ZFS pool
    support bookmarks. The --no-use-bookmark option disables this
    safety feature but is discouraged, because bookmarks help to ensure
    that ZFS replication can continue even if source and destination
    dataset somehow have no common snapshot anymore.

    Note that it does not matter whether a bookmark was created by bzfs
    or a third party script, as only the GUID of the bookmark and the
    GUID of the snapshot is considered for comparison, and ZFS
    guarantees that any bookmark of a given snapshot automatically has
    the same GUID, transaction group number and creation time as the
    snapshot. Also note that you can create, delete and prune bookmarks
    any way you like, as bzfs (without --no-use-bookmark) will happily
    work with whatever bookmarks currently exist, if any.

    If the variable contains a non-empty CLI value then that value is
    used. Else if a default value for the variable exists in the JSON
    file that default value is used. Else the program aborts with an
    error. Example: In the JSON variable
    `${syslog_address:/dev/log}`, the variable name is
    'syslog_address' and the default value is '/dev/log'. The
    default value is the portion after the optional : colon within the
    variable declaration. The default value is used if the CLI user does
    not specify a non-empty value via --log-config-var, for example via
    --log-config-var syslog_address:/path/to/socket_file or via
    --log-config-var syslog_address:[host,port].

    bzfs automatically supplies the following convenience variables:
    `${bzfs.log_level}`, `${bzfs.log_dir}`, `${bzfs.log_file}`,
    `${bzfs.sub.logger}`, `${bzfs.get_default_log_formatter}`,
    `${bzfs.timestamp}`. For a complete list see the source code of
    get_dict_config_logger().

<div id="--include-envvar-regex"></div>

**--include-envvar-regex** *REGEX [REGEX ...]*

*  On program startup, unset all Unix environment variables for which
    the full environment variable name matches at least one of the
    excludes but none of the includes. If an environment variable is
    included this decision is never reconsidered because include takes
    precedence over exclude. The purpose is to tighten security and help
    guard against accidental inheritance or malicious injection of
    environment variable values that may have unintended effects.

    This option can be specified multiple times. A leading `!`
    character indicates logical negation, i.e. the regex matches if the
    regex with the leading `!` character removed does not match. The
    default is to include no environment variables, i.e. to make no
    exceptions to --exclude-envvar-regex. Example that retains at least
    these two env vars: `--include-envvar-regex PATH
    --include-envvar-regex bzfs_min_pipe_transfer_size`. Example that
    retains all environment variables without tightened security:
    `'.*'`

# ZFS-RECV-O (EXPERIMENTAL)

The following group of parameters specifies additional zfs receive
'-o' options that can be used to configure the copying of ZFS dataset
properties from the source dataset to its corresponding destination
dataset. The 'zfs-recv-o' group of parameters is applied before the
'zfs-recv-x' group.

<div id="--zfs-recv-o-targets"></div>

**--zfs-recv-o-targets** *{full,incremental,full+incremental}*

*  The zfs send phase or phases during which the extra '-o' options
    are passed to 'zfs receive'. This can be one of the following
    choices: 'full', 'incremental', 'full+incremental'. Default is
    'full+incremental'. A 'full' send is sometimes also known as an
    'initial' send.

<!-- -->

<div id="--zfs-recv-o-sources"></div>

**--zfs-recv-o-sources** *STRING*

*  The ZFS sources to provide to the 'zfs get -s' CLI in order to
    fetch the ZFS dataset properties that will be fed into the
    --zfs-recv-o-include/exclude-regex filter (see below). The sources
    are in the form of a comma-separated list (no spaces) containing one
    or more of the following choices: 'local', 'default',
    'inherited', 'temporary', 'received', 'none', with the
    default being 'local'. Uses 'zfs get -p -s $zfs-recv-o-sources
    all $SRC_DATASET' to fetch the properties to copy -
    https://openzfs.github.io/openzfs-docs/man/master/8/zfs-get.8.html.
    P.S: Note that the existing 'zfs send --props' option does not
    filter and that --props only reads properties from the 'local'
    ZFS property source (https://github.com/openzfs/zfs/issues/13024).

<!-- -->

<div id="--zfs-recv-o-include-regex"></div>

**--zfs-recv-o-include-regex** *REGEX [REGEX ...]*

*  Take the output properties of --zfs-recv-o-sources (see above) and
    filter them such that we only retain the properties whose name
    matches at least one of the --include regexes but none of the
    --exclude regexes. If a property is excluded this decision is never
    reconsidered because exclude takes precedence over include. Append
    each retained property to the list of '-o' options in
    --zfs-recv-program-opt(s), unless another '-o' or '-x' option
    with the same name already exists therein. In other words,
    --zfs-recv-program-opt(s) takes precedence.

    The --zfs-recv-o-include-regex option can be specified multiple
    times. A leading `!` character indicates logical negation, i.e.
    the regex matches if the regex with the leading `!` character
    removed does not match. If the option starts with a `+` prefix
    then regexes are read from the newline-separated UTF-8 text file
    given after the `+` prefix, one regex per line inside of the text
    file.

    The default is to include no properties, thus by default no extra
    '-o' option is appended. Example: `--zfs-recv-o-include-regex
    recordsize volblocksize`. More examples: `.*` (include all
    properties), `foo bar myapp:.*` (include three regexes)
    `+zfs-recv-o_regexes.txt`, `+/path/to/zfs-recv-o_regexes.txt`

    --zfs-recv-o-exclude-regex encryptionroot keystatus origin
    volblocksize volsize

# ZFS-RECV-X (EXPERIMENTAL)

The following group of parameters specifies additional zfs receive
'-x' options that can be used to configure the copying of ZFS dataset
properties from the source dataset to its corresponding destination
dataset. The 'zfs-recv-o' group of parameters is applied before the
'zfs-recv-x' group.

<div id="--zfs-recv-x-targets"></div>

**--zfs-recv-x-targets** *{full,incremental,full+incremental}*

*  The zfs send phase or phases during which the extra '-x' options
    are passed to 'zfs receive'. This can be one of the following
    choices: 'full', 'incremental', 'full+incremental'. Default is
    'full+incremental'. A 'full' send is sometimes also known as an

    filter and that --props only reads properties from the 'local'
    ZFS property source (https://github.com/openzfs/zfs/issues/13024).
    Thus, -x opts do not benefit from source != 'local' (which is the
