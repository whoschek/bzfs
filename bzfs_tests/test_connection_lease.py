        """Purpose: Establish that renaming a lease lockfile to itself is a guaranteed no-op on POSIX filesystems and
        must never raise, even when the file is currently locked and located under ``used/``. This behavior matters
        because the implementation intentionally relies on atomic ``os.rename`` for state transitions between
        ``free/`` and ``used/`` and, in salvage scenarios, may rename a file to its identical target as a benign
        operation. The test ensures that such a self-rename cannot corrupt state, revoke locks, or trigger spurious
        exceptions that would mask real failures.

        Assumptions: Standard POSIX semantics apply to ``os.rename`` and ``os.replace``; advisory ``flock`` does not
        interfere with metadata updates on the directory entry and remains held on the underlying inode across a
        rename. The test runs in an isolated temporary directory and controls the entire subtree without concurrent
        writers.

        Design Rationale: Probing the self-rename edge case guards against platform quirks and accidental future
        refactors that might introduce unnecessary preconditions around rename calls. By performing both
        ``os.rename(p, p)`` and ``os.replace(p, p)``, we validate that either API surface behaves as a no-op, which
        simplifies the production code and allows rename operations to be written without explicit source/target
        equality checks in the hot path. The test focuses on observable behavior (no exception, file still present,
        lock intact) to keep the contract crisp and stable over time.

    def test_manager_acquire_release(self) -> None:
        """Purpose: Validate the end-to-end lifecycle of a connection lease, covering acquisition of two distinct
        leases, directory placement in ``used/`` during ownership, and safe release back to ``free/`` with proper file
        movement. Also verifies the ControlPath directory is consistent across leases and that unique names are
        allocated. The scenario models the common pattern where multiple bzfs processes acquire independent leases for
        the same endpoint namespace, ensuring there is no cross-talk between names and no leakage of state.

        Assumptions: POSIX filesystem semantics, advisory ``flock`` behavior, and atomic ``os.rename`` are available.
        The temporary directory is not meddled with by other processes. Only this test manipulates files under the
        manager's root. The OS permits creating Unix domain socket paths in the generated directory and enforces
        standard permission bits. Names are generated with high entropy to minimize collisions.

        Design Rationale: The test asserts the strongest externally observable invariants rather than internal
        implementation details. It checks both presence and absence of files in ``used/`` and ``free/`` at the right
        times, uniqueness of socket names, and directory equivalence to ensure that distinct leases share the same
        ControlPath base. The finally block releases in reverse order to surface ordering bugs, and validates that
        releases are idempotent with the expected terminal state. By examining both path equality across directories
        and directory basenames, it also guards against subtle directory misconfiguration and accidental path joins.

        Assumptions: The ``free/`` directory contains exactly one matching candidate and no other concurrent writer is
        racing on the same root. The OS path length cap is respected by construction. Non-following open flags and
        symlink checks remain active and uncompromised. Both managers operate within the same namespace root and see
        identical filesystem state.

        Design Rationale: Reuse minimizes churn and reduces namespace fragmentation when a live or recently used master
        exists. Creating the socket path ensures ``_find_and_acquire()`` preserves the entry, thereby verifying the
        preferred fast-path reuse behavior. A negative probe via ``_try_lock`` on a second manager demonstrates that
        re-acquired leases cannot be stolen while held, preserving the concurrency contract. The final assertions

        """Purpose: Verify salvage semantics from ``used/`` when a previous owner crashed and released the advisory lock
        implicitly. The manager should detect the unlocked file, acquire it, and maintain it in ``used/`` during the
        new lease, thereby preventing name leaks and ensuring continuity of ControlPath usage across process lifetimes.

        Assumptions: The test can safely write a file into ``used/`` to simulate a crash scenario. File system state is
        otherwise quiescent, and no lock is present on the crafted file. Only this process owns the directory. POSIX
        advisory locks are honored and will fail non-blocking acquisition only when truly held by another process.

        Design Rationale: Salvage is essential for robustness; it avoids leaking names and prevents unbounded growth of
        ControlPath files after process failures. Directly creating an unlocked file in ``used/`` and then acquiring a
        lease exercises the recovery path deterministically. A secondary lock attempt via ``_try_lock`` affirms that
        once the test holds the lease, normal exclusion guarantees apply. The test keeps assertions focused on visible
        behaviors rather than implementation internals and validates that the socket name is preserved exactly, which is
        important for operators correlating logs with filesystem artifacts during incident analysis.

        are empty, and enforces the Unix domain socket path length cap to remain compatible with portable kernels. A
        correct creation path is crucial for first-use latency and correctness, as there is no opportunity to reuse or
        salvage existing entries.

        Assumptions: The temporary root is empty and writable, the OS path length limit from the utility module closely
        matches the platform's effective limit, and URL-safe base64 encoding avoids dangerous characters. Only the
        current process interacts with the directory. Underlying filesystem supports atomic directory entry updates and
        respects explicit permission masks.

        Design Rationale: Creation is a critical fallback that must be correct on first attempt without retries or
        partial files. The test asserts a recognizable "s" prefix, presence in ``used/`` while held, and length not
        exceeding the configured cap. This keeps the test fast, deterministic, and independent from system SSH behavior,
        while still validating correctness constraints that impact real-world stability. It also implicitly exercises

        opaque, late failures inside OpenSSH that would otherwise manifest as confusing connection errors or timeouts.

        Assumptions: Regular filesystem paths can exceed the Unix domain socket limit; the check is a proactive guard
        before SSH uses the ControlPath. The test constructs an intentionally long ``root_dir`` to trigger the
        validation deterministically. The OS honors the commonly accepted limit reflected by
        ``UNIX_DOMAIN_SOCKET_PATH_MAX_LENGTH`` and raises no other unrelated errors when creating directories.

        Design Rationale: Early validation provides a better operator experience and reduces triage time by pointing
        directly to the misconfiguration. By testing that ``acquire()`` raises with a clear message, we assert not only
        correctness but also the quality of diagnostics. This ensures that production failures result in self-explanatory
        errors, allowing quick remediation (choosing a shorter home or socket directory). The isolation in a temporary
