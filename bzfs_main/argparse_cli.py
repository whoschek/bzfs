    parser: argparse.ArgumentParser = argparse.ArgumentParser(
        prog=PROG_NAME,
        allow_abbrev=False,
        formatter_class=argparse.RawTextHelpFormatter,
        description=f"""
*{PROG_NAME} is a backup command line tool that reliably replicates ZFS snapshots from a (local or remote)
source ZFS dataset (ZFS filesystem or ZFS volume) and its descendant datasets to a (local or remote)
destination ZFS dataset to make the destination dataset a recursively synchronized copy of the source dataset,
using zfs send/receive/rollback/destroy and ssh tunnel as directed. For example, {PROG_NAME} can be used to
incrementally replicate all ZFS snapshots since the most recent common snapshot from source to destination,
in order to help protect against data loss or ransomware.*

When run for the first time, {PROG_NAME} replicates the dataset and all its snapshots from the source to the
destination. On subsequent runs, {PROG_NAME} transfers only the data that has changed since the previous run,
i.e. it incrementally replicates to the destination all intermediate snapshots that have been created on
the source since the last run. Source ZFS snapshots older than the most recent common snapshot found on the
destination are auto-skipped.

Unless {PROG_NAME} is explicitly told to create snapshots on the source, it treats the source as read-only,
thus the source remains unmodified. With the --dryrun flag, {PROG_NAME} also treats the destination as read-only.
In normal operation, {PROG_NAME} treats the destination as append-only. Optional CLI flags are available to
delete destination snapshots and destination datasets as directed, for example to make the destination
identical to the source if the two have somehow diverged in unforeseen ways. This easily enables
(re)synchronizing the backup from the production state, as well as restoring the production state from
backup.

In the spirit of rsync, {PROG_NAME} supports a variety of powerful include/exclude filters that can be combined to
select which datasets, snapshots and properties to create, replicate, delete or compare.

Typically, a `cron` job on the source host runs `{PROG_NAME}` periodically to create new snapshots and prune outdated
snapshots on the source, whereas another `cron` job on the destination host runs `{PROG_NAME}` periodically to prune
outdated destination snapshots. Yet another `cron` job runs `{PROG_NAME}` periodically to replicate the recently created
snapshots from the source to the destination. The frequency of these periodic activities is typically every N milliseconds,
every second, minute, hour, day, week, month and/or year (or multiples thereof).

All {PROG_NAME} functions including snapshot creation, replication, deletion, monitoring, comparison, etc. happily work
with any snapshots in any format, even created or managed by third party ZFS snapshot management tools, including manual
zfs snapshot/destroy. All functions can also be used independently. That is, if you wish you can use {PROG_NAME} just
for creating snapshots, or just for replicating, or just for deleting/pruning, or just for monitoring, or just for
comparing snapshot lists.

The source 'pushes to' the destination whereas the destination 'pulls from' the source. {PROG_NAME} is installed
and executed on the 'initiator' host which can be either the host that contains the source dataset (push mode),
or the destination dataset (pull mode), or both datasets (local mode, no network required, no ssh required),
or any third-party (even non-ZFS OSX) host as long as that host is able to SSH (via standard 'ssh' OpenSSH CLI) into
both the source and destination host (pull-push mode). In pull-push mode the source 'zfs send's the data stream
to the initiator which immediately pipes the stream (without storing anything locally) to the destination
host that 'zfs receive's it. Pull-push mode means that {PROG_NAME} need not be installed or executed on either
source or destination host. Only the underlying 'zfs' CLI must be installed on both source and destination host.
{PROG_NAME} can run as root or non-root user, in the latter case via a) sudo or b) when granted corresponding
ZFS permissions by administrators via 'zfs allow' delegation mechanism.

{PROG_NAME} is written in Python and continuously runs a wide set of unit tests and integration tests to ensure
coverage and compatibility with old and new versions of ZFS on Linux, FreeBSD and Solaris, on all Python
versions â‰¥ 3.8 (including latest stable which is currently python-3.13).

{PROG_NAME} is a stand-alone program with zero required dependencies, akin to a
stand-alone shell script or binary executable. It is designed to be able to run in restricted barebones server
environments. No external Python packages are required; indeed no Python package management at all is required.
You can just symlink the program wherever you like, for example into /usr/local/bin or similar, and simply run it like
any stand-alone shell script or binary executable.

{PROG_NAME} automatically replicates the snapshots of multiple datasets in parallel for best performance.
Similarly, it quickly deletes (or monitors or compares) snapshots of multiple datasets in parallel. Atomic snapshots can be
created as frequently as every N milliseconds.

Optionally, {PROG_NAME} applies bandwidth rate-limiting and progress monitoring (via 'pv' CLI) during 'zfs
send/receive' data transfers. When run across the network, {PROG_NAME} also transparently inserts lightweight
data compression (via 'zstd -1' CLI) and efficient data buffering (via 'mbuffer' CLI) into the pipeline
between network endpoints during 'zfs send/receive' network transfers. If one of these utilities is not
installed this is auto-detected, and the operation continues reliably without the corresponding auxiliary
feature.

# Periodic Jobs with bzfs_jobrunner

The software also ships with the [bzfs_jobrunner](README_bzfs_jobrunner.md) companion program, which is a convenience
wrapper around `{PROG_NAME}` that simplifies efficient periodic ZFS snapshot creation, replication, pruning, and monitoring,
across a fleet of N source hosts and M destination hosts, using a single shared fleet-wide
[jobconfig](bzfs_tests/bzfs_job_example.py) script. For example, this simplifies the deployment of an efficient
geo-replicated backup service where each of the M destination hosts is located in a separate geographic region and pulls
replicas from (the same set of) N source hosts. It also simplifies low latency replication from a primary to a secondary or
to M read replicas, or backup to removable drives, etc.

# Quickstart

* Create adhoc atomic snapshots without a schedule:

```$ {PROG_NAME} tank1/foo/bar dummy --recursive --skip-replication --create-src-snapshots
--create-src-snapshots-plan "{create_src_snapshots_plan_example1}"```

```$ zfs list -t snapshot tank1/foo/bar

tank1/foo/bar@test_2024-11-06_08:30:05_adhoc```

* Create periodic atomic snapshots on a schedule, every hour and every day, by launching this from a periodic `cron` job:

```$ {PROG_NAME} tank1/foo/bar dummy --recursive --skip-replication --create-src-snapshots
--create-src-snapshots-plan "{create_src_snapshots_plan_example2}"```

```$ zfs list -t snapshot tank1/foo/bar

tank1/foo/bar@prod_us-west-1_2024-11-06_08:30:05_daily

tank1/foo/bar@prod_us-west-1_2024-11-06_08:30:05_hourly```

Note: A periodic snapshot is created if it is due per the schedule indicated by its suffix (e.g. `_daily` or `_hourly`
or `_minutely` or `_2secondly` or `_100millisecondly`), or if the --create-src-snapshots-even-if-not-due flag is specified,
or if the most recent scheduled snapshot is somehow missing. In the latter case {PROG_NAME} immediately creates a snapshot
(named with the current time, not backdated to the missed time), and then resumes the original schedule. If the suffix is
`_adhoc` or not a known period then a snapshot is considered non-periodic and is thus created immediately regardless of the
creation time of any existing snapshot.

* Replication example in local mode (no network, no ssh), to replicate ZFS dataset tank1/foo/bar to tank2/boo/bar:

```$ {PROG_NAME} tank1/foo/bar tank2/boo/bar```

```$ zfs list -t snapshot tank1/foo/bar

tank1/foo/bar@prod_us-west-1_2024-11-06_08:30:05_daily

tank1/foo/bar@prod_us-west-1_2024-11-06_08:30:05_hourly```

```$ zfs list -t snapshot tank2/boo/bar

tank2/boo/bar@prod_us-west-1_2024-11-06_08:30:05_daily

tank2/boo/bar@prod_us-west-1_2024-11-06_08:30:05_hourly```

* Same example in pull mode:

```$ {PROG_NAME} root@host1.example.com:tank1/foo/bar tank2/boo/bar```

* Same example in push mode:

```$ {PROG_NAME} tank1/foo/bar root@host2.example.com:tank2/boo/bar```

* Same example in pull-push mode:

```$ {PROG_NAME} root@host1:tank1/foo/bar root@host2:tank2/boo/bar```

* Example in local mode (no network, no ssh) to recursively replicate ZFS dataset tank1/foo/bar and its descendant
datasets to tank2/boo/bar:

```$ {PROG_NAME} tank1/foo/bar tank2/boo/bar --recursive```

```$ zfs list -t snapshot -r tank1/foo/bar

tank1/foo/bar@prod_us-west-1_2024-11-06_08:30:05_daily

tank1/foo/bar@prod_us-west-1_2024-11-06_08:30:05_hourly

tank1/foo/bar/baz@prod_us-west-1_2024-11-06_08:40:00_daily

tank1/foo/bar/baz@prod_us-west-1_2024-11-06_08:40:00_hourly```

```$ zfs list -t snapshot -r tank2/boo/bar

tank2/boo/bar@prod_us-west-1_2024-11-06_08:30:05_daily

tank2/boo/bar@prod_us-west-1_2024-11-06_08:30:05_hourly

tank2/boo/bar/baz@prod_us-west-1_2024-11-06_08:40:00_daily

tank2/boo/bar/baz@prod_us-west-1_2024-11-06_08:40:00_hourly```

* Example that makes destination identical to source even if the two have drastically diverged:

```$ {PROG_NAME} tank1/foo/bar tank2/boo/bar --recursive --force --delete-dst-datasets --delete-dst-snapshots```

* Replicate all daily snapshots created during the last 7 days, and at the same time ensure that the latest 7 daily
snapshots (per dataset) are replicated regardless of creation time:

```$ {PROG_NAME} tank1/foo/bar tank2/boo/bar --recursive --include-snapshot-regex '.*_daily'
--include-snapshot-times-and-ranks '7 days ago..anytime' 'latest 7'```

Note: The example above compares the specified times against the standard ZFS 'creation' time property of the snapshots
(which is a UTC Unix time in integer seconds), rather than against a timestamp that may be part of the snapshot name.

* Delete all daily snapshots older than 7 days, but ensure that the latest 7 daily snapshots (per dataset) are retained
regardless of creation time:

```$ {PROG_NAME} {DUMMY_DATASET} tank2/boo/bar --dryrun --recursive --skip-replication --delete-dst-snapshots
--include-snapshot-regex '.*_daily' --include-snapshot-times-and-ranks notime 'all except latest 7'
--include-snapshot-times-and-ranks 'anytime..7 days ago'```

Note: This also prints how many GB of disk space in total would be freed if the command were to be run for real without
the --dryrun flag.

* Delete all daily snapshots older than 7 days, but ensure that the latest 7 daily snapshots (per dataset) are retained
regardless of creation time. Additionally, only delete a snapshot if no corresponding snapshot or bookmark exists in
the source dataset (same as above except replace the 'dummy' source with 'tank1/foo/bar'):

```$ {PROG_NAME} tank1/foo/bar tank2/boo/bar --dryrun --recursive --skip-replication --delete-dst-snapshots
--include-snapshot-regex '.*_daily' --include-snapshot-times-and-ranks notime 'all except latest 7'
--include-snapshot-times-and-ranks '7 days ago..anytime'```

* Delete all daily snapshots older than 7 days, but ensure that the latest 7 daily snapshots (per dataset) are retained
regardless of creation time. Additionally, only delete a snapshot if no corresponding snapshot exists in the source
dataset (same as above except append 'no-crosscheck'):

```$ {PROG_NAME} tank1/foo/bar tank2/boo/bar --dryrun --recursive --skip-replication --delete-dst-snapshots
--include-snapshot-regex '.*_daily' --include-snapshot-times-and-ranks notime 'all except latest 7'
--include-snapshot-times-and-ranks 'anytime..7 days ago' --delete-dst-snapshots-no-crosscheck```

* Delete all daily bookmarks older than 90 days, but retain the latest 200 daily bookmarks (per dataset) regardless
of creation time:

```$ {PROG_NAME} {DUMMY_DATASET} tank1/foo/bar --dryrun --recursive --skip-replication --delete-dst-snapshots=bookmarks
--include-snapshot-regex '.*_daily' --include-snapshot-times-and-ranks notime 'all except latest 200'
--include-snapshot-times-and-ranks 'anytime..90 days ago'```

* Delete all tmp datasets within tank2/boo/bar:

```$ {PROG_NAME} {DUMMY_DATASET} tank2/boo/bar --dryrun --recursive --skip-replication --delete-dst-datasets
--include-dataset-regex '(.*/)?tmp.*' --exclude-dataset-regex '!.*'```

* Retain all secondly snapshots that were created less than 40 seconds ago, and ensure that the latest 40
secondly snapshots (per dataset) are retained regardless of creation time. Same for 40 minutely snapshots, 36 hourly
snapshots, 31 daily snapshots, 12 weekly snapshots, 18 monthly snapshots, and 5 yearly snapshots:

```$ {PROG_NAME} {DUMMY_DATASET} tank2/boo/bar --dryrun --recursive --skip-replication --delete-dst-snapshots
--delete-dst-snapshots-except
--include-snapshot-regex '.*_secondly' --include-snapshot-times-and-ranks '40 seconds ago..anytime' 'latest 40'
--new-snapshot-filter-group
--include-snapshot-regex '.*_minutely' --include-snapshot-times-and-ranks '40 minutes ago..anytime' 'latest 40'
--new-snapshot-filter-group
--include-snapshot-regex '.*_hourly' --include-snapshot-times-and-ranks '36 hours ago..anytime' 'latest 36'
--new-snapshot-filter-group
--include-snapshot-regex '.*_daily' --include-snapshot-times-and-ranks '31 days ago..anytime' 'latest 31'
--new-snapshot-filter-group
--include-snapshot-regex '.*_weekly' --include-snapshot-times-and-ranks '12 weeks ago..anytime' 'latest 12'
--new-snapshot-filter-group
--include-snapshot-regex '.*_monthly' --include-snapshot-times-and-ranks '18 months ago..anytime' 'latest 18'
--new-snapshot-filter-group
--include-snapshot-regex '.*_yearly' --include-snapshot-times-and-ranks '5 years ago..anytime' 'latest 5'```

For convenience, the lengthy command line above can be expressed in a more concise way, like so:

```$ {PROG_NAME} {DUMMY_DATASET} tank2/boo/bar --dryrun --recursive --skip-replication --delete-dst-snapshots
--delete-dst-snapshots-except-plan "{delete_dst_snapshots_except_plan_example1}"```

* Compare source and destination dataset trees recursively, for example to check if all recently taken snapshots have
been successfully replicated by a periodic job. List snapshots only contained in src (tagged with 'src'),
only contained in dst (tagged with 'dst'), and contained in both src and dst (tagged with 'all'), restricted to hourly
and daily snapshots taken within the last 7 days, excluding the last 4 hours (to allow for some slack/stragglers),
excluding temporary datasets:

```$ {PROG_NAME} tank1/foo/bar tank2/boo/bar --skip-replication --compare-snapshot-lists=src+dst+all --recursive
--include-snapshot-regex '.*_(hourly|daily)' --include-snapshot-times-and-ranks '7 days ago..4 hours ago'
--exclude-dataset-regex '(.*/)?tmp.*'```

If the resulting TSV output file contains zero lines starting with the prefix 'src' and zero lines starting with the
prefix 'dst' then no source snapshots are missing on the destination, and no destination snapshots are missing
on the source, indicating that the periodic replication and pruning jobs perform as expected. The TSV output is sorted
by dataset, and by ZFS creation time within each dataset - the first and last line prefixed with 'all' contains the
metadata of the oldest and latest common snapshot, respectively. The --compare-snapshot-lists option also directly
logs various summary stats, such as the metadata of the latest common snapshot, latest snapshots and oldest snapshots,
as well as the time diff between the latest common snapshot and latest snapshot only in src (and only in dst), as well
as how many src snapshots and how many GB of data are missing on dst, etc.

* Example with further options:

```$ {PROG_NAME} tank1/foo/bar root@host2.example.com:tank2/boo/bar --recursive
--exclude-snapshot-regex '.*_(secondly|minutely)' --exclude-snapshot-regex 'test_.*'
--include-snapshot-times-and-ranks '7 days ago..anytime' 'latest 7' --exclude-dataset /tank1/foo/bar/temporary
--exclude-dataset /tank1/foo/bar/baz/trash --exclude-dataset-regex '(.*/)?private'
--exclude-dataset-regex '(.*/)?[Tt][Ee]?[Mm][Pp][-_]?[0-9]*'```
