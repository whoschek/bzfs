description = """
bzfs is a backup command line tool that reliably replicates ZFS snapshots from a (local or remote) source ZFS dataset \
(ZFS filesystem or ZFS volume) and its descendant datasets to a (local or remote) destination ZFS dataset to make the \
destination dataset a recursively synchronized copy of the source dataset, using zfs send/receive/rollback/destroy and \
ssh tunnel as directed. bzfs can be used to incrementally replicate all ZFS snapshots since the most recent common \
snapshot from source to destination."""
